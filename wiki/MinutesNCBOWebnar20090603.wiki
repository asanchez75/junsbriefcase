#Using Ontologies for Visualizing Design Heterogeneity in Human Studies

Abstract: The human studyome is the totality of all human studies
worldwide, encompassing all interventional, observational and qualitative
research on human subjects. The human studyome is one of the most valuable
sources of knowledge for advancing the understanding of diseases and
treatments. Dr. Sim will discuss her NCBO Driving Biological Project that
sought to use ontologies to visualize design heterogeneity in randomized
trials for comparative effectiveness researchers. She will also discuss
some observations on the benefits and challenges of applying ontologies
and ontology tools to computerizing the human studyome and to clinical
research in general.
