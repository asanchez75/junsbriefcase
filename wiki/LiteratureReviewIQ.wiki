Data quality can be measured through subjective as well as objective assessments.

Subjective assessments could reflect different opinions, needs, and experiences of different types of users in an organization, such as the information providers and the consumers. They are often conducted using questionnaires. A good example of such a questionnaire refers to Lee et al.

Objective assessments can be task-independent or task-dependent. The latter has to consider things like the organization's business rules, regulations, etc.

The subjective and objective assessments can be conducted together in order to inform each other.

The paper also proposes three functional forms that can be used for objective assessment, namely:
 * simple ratio, for criteria including concise representation, relevancy, and ease of manipulation.
 * min or max operation, for criteria such as believability, appropriate amount of data, timeliness and accessibility.
 * weighted average, for multivariate cases.
