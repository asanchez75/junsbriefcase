shows how to use jena.rdfcat to convert rdf files from one format to another. 

= Details =

cd /root/workspace/oai2sparql

export OAITOSPARQLROOT=/root/workspace/oai2sparql

CP="$(./oai2sparql_path)"

$JAVA_HOME/jre/bin/java" -cp "$CP" jena.rdfcat -out N3 go_daily-termdb-20090122.owl > go_daily-termdb-20090122.n3


Note that,
* it did not work when the owl file was not in the local directory
* it did not work when the command options were given in a different order


I did not try to make sure that it has to be in this order, but this command worked.

It was run using Jena 2.*.
