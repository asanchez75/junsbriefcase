#SADI & CardioSHARE - a new perspective on Semantic Web Services 

Abstract: The "Deep Web" is a term used to refer to all of the data on the Internet 
that is hidden behind interfaces and/or generated by analytical 
algorithms, and is therefore inaccessible to search engines. The quantity 
of data in the Deep Web is estimated to be several orders of magnitude 
greater than that on the surface Web, and it is therefore critical that we 
carefully consider how to make these resources available as we attempt to 
build the Semantic Web for healthcare and life sciences. Our experiences 
running the BioMoby project have taught us a great deal about the nature 
and behaviours of Semantic Web Services in the bioinformatics space. We 
have now applied this experience to a new Semantic Web Service framework - 
SADI (Semantic Automated Discovery and Integration) - which attempts to 
expose Deep Web data in a straightforward, standards-compliant manner. 
SADI does not define any new technologies, message structures or 
ontologies; it merely circumscribes a set of recommended practices for 
bioinformatics service providers that result in highly interoperable 
behaviours between disparate resources on the Semantic Web. In this talk 
I will present the rationale behind the SADI middleware, and show its 
interoperable behaviours through demonstrations of two very different 
client applications. Finally, I will introduce the CardioSHARE project, 
where OWL-DL ontologies are used to drive the discovery of cardiovascular 
data and analytical tools on the Semantic Web via the SADI framework. 
CardioSHARE demonstrates the significant additional power obtained through 
defining ontological classes based on their properties rather than 
asserted IS-A hierarchies; we hope that such demonstrations will provide 
incentive for the community to move toward these richer ontological 
descriptions. 

Bioinformaticians just do not have the same level of domain knowledge as biologists. So what can we do?

SADI:
 * most bioinformatics services have implicit semantic relationship between inputs and outputs of web service -> SADI to make it explicit
 * 

Demo (Knowledge explorer)
 * find the genes 
 * what can SADI find for me for these two genes
  * what these genes encode 
 * SADI, what can you tell me about these proteins
  * 3-D structure, GO terms, etc
 * Get the Go terms

Demo: Share, the application to SADI
 * use a SPARQL endpoint
 * find answers by finding the right web services and invoke these services

CADIO share
 * make SADI accessible to cadio researchers
 * late binding, the semantics of data is not given until the last moment it is needed; interpret on the run time
 * execute ontologies as workflows
