162 records were returned. Some of them might be new records added since February.

Query to FlyBase Site Release2009-02 returns 160 records. New references are:

 * http://flybase.org/cgi-bin/fbidq.html?FBrf0205083

Query to FlyBase RDF SPARQL endpoint updated in 2009-02 returns 159 records. The missed reference is:
 * http://flybase.org/reports/FBrf0057329.html (flybase:pub_id=>2189960)

Very strange! This record is not in the database for this gene, using the above query! 
This means that, to get all the records for this gene, we might need to query other publication-relevant tables.
