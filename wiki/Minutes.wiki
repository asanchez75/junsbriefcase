 * slide 6: we need different identifiers for the same protein which exhibits different  functioanlities
 * slide 7: we can't generate identifiers for all possible structure combinations, we should automatically generate an identifier based on the structure
 * slide 8:inchl: provides the structure of a chemical compound; for molecular strcuture
 * slide 12; tools, InchiKeys, OpenBabel (struggle with anything over 100 residues)
 * slide 13: openbabel: IUPAC, SMILES, InCHI; SDF and CML can represent any information
 * slide 32, generate an identifier from the RDF/XML description of a structure
 * the example from UniProt: HIF1alpha
