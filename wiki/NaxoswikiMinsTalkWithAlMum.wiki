Al gave the outline of the vision:
 * use the web to access distributed data rather than drawing everything together
 * everybody would use a unified and standardized way, working on an agreed format of data
 * find a common way to link data together

Feedback from J.:
 * You might to answer all sorts of questions in your application
 * Take care of the changes of genes from one organism to another

Feedbacks from J. for writing up;
 * make your terminologies clear, and readable
 * give a clear set of aims, as bulletins
 * explain the science in simple words
 * make sure that ppl don't need to go to the web to check things when reading your application
 * you should make it look that you understand what you are doing
 * reiterative what you want to achieve three times
 * give examples to show that your tools are transferable to a wider community

Genetic studies in developmental biology:
 * genes get used differently throughout the evolution
 * the same gene might give different expression at different sites or development stages
 * a whole family of Drosophila genes might also be recognized in the bacteria family
 * Drosophila genes could guide the research in other organisms

What you will do once you find a gene of interest:
 * dig into the human genome using db such as Ensemble (can do comparative genome searching)
 * look for genes controlling XXX infection
 * locate a whole pile of genes in a narrow chromosome, and then do bioinformatics search to narrow down a particular gene by searching for the orthologue of the gene in other organisms
 * if no function annotations were found, go to sequence databases, to search for genes in other organism
 * find out where the gene is expressed, such as the brain or the eyes
 * find out where and when the orthologues of the gene are expressed
 * find out which copy of a gene is expressed
 * change in the environment might influence how the gene is expressed, e.g. might upset the gene expression pattern during early pregnancy

Pathway studies:
 * get some statistical information about a whole pile of genes
