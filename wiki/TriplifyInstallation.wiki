= Fix the php-pgsql driver problem =
Run
{{{
yum update php5
yum install php-pgsql
}}}

Configure /etc/php.ini, add
{{{
extension=pgsql.so
}}}

The pgsql.so file is installed at /usr/lib/php/modules/ together with mysql.so.

Also, I needed to comment out the line of 
{{{
$this->pdo->setAttribute(eval('return PDO::MYSQL_ATTR_USE_BUFFERED_QUERY;'),false); 
}}}

in the index.php file for Triplify 5.*. Because that line works particularly for MYSQL databases but not required for the PostgreSQL.

Notes:
 * installed in /var/www/html/. It can be installed somewhere else and set up a redirect in /etc/httpd/conf.d/triplify.host
 * created config.flyted.inc.php and config.flybase.inc.php configuration file. they need to be included in the index.php file.
 * the key is to configure the $triplify['LinkedDataDepth']='1'; right
 * to check whether everything works well, we can go to http://localhost/triplify/feature/ and see whether some RDF statements could be returned. The metadata can also be returned as JSON format by configuring index.php file.
