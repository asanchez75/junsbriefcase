#summary Email draft to keep in record.

Dear Neurocommons developers,

Lately I have used the Neurocommons knowledge base hosted at DERI (http://hcls.deri.org:8080). I want to query for pubmed records about a gene . I believer there are information relevant to pubmed information in three seperate graphs in the Neurocommons KB:
 # http://purl.org/science/graph/ncbi/gene-pubmed
 # http://purl.org/science/graph/medline/titles-years
 # http://purl.org/science/graph/medline/subject-headings


I was able to find pubmed records using an NCBI gene identifier from the graph http://purl.org/science/graph/ncbi/gene-pubmed, for example,
{{{
select distinct ?gene
from <http://purl.org/science/graph/ncbi/gene-pubmed>
where
{
  ?gene <http://purl.org/science/owl/sciencecommons/describes_gene_or_gene_product_mentioned_by> <http://purl.org/science/article/pmid/7789765>
} 
}}}

And I was able to find some bibliographic information and mesh terms associated with a publication record from graphs 2 and 3, for example,
{{{
PREFIX dc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/>
PREFIX sc: <http://purl.org/science/owl/sciencecommons/>

ask
from <http://purl.org/science/graph/medline/subject-headings>
from <http://purl.org/science/graph/medline/titles-years>
where
{
 <http://purl.org/commons/article/pmid/7789765> sc:identified_by_pmid ?pmid ;
                                                dc:date ?pubdate; dc:title ?pubtitle .
 ?pmid ?p ?mesh .
} 
}}}

However, I noticed that thre are three types of URIs associated a pubmed  article:
 # http://purl.org/science/article/pmid/7789765
 # http://purl.org/commons/article/pmid/7789765
 # http://purl.org/commons/record/pmid/7789765

I can understandt that the usage of URIs 2 and 3 might be a result of applying the cool URI principle, however, I am not sure whether URI_1 should have some sort of relationship with either URI_2 or URI_3 in the KB. The missing link of URI_1 to others kind of introduce a gap in the dataset. Please note the difference of "science/article" and "commons/article" between URI_1 and URI_2.
