== Ginkgo ==
 * "Medlineplus" (http://medlineplus.gov/) developed by the National Library of Medicine in US, which contains information including drug and supplements (e.g., herbs). For example, one of the supplements that I found is Ginkgo (http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/natural/patient-ginkgo.html) that is used for the treatment of numerous conditions (e.g., Alzheimer's Disease), many of which are under scientific investigation (there is a section listing related scientific studies). In addition, there is section on drug interactions.

 * In Chinese/English Wikipedia, there are pages describing Ginkgo (see the URL's below).

  ** http://dbpedia.org/page/Ginkgo_biloba
  ** http://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%93%B6%E6%9D%8F

 * In clinicaltrials.gov, one can find quite a number of clinical trials involving Ginkgo (see http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=ginkgo).

== Huang Lian Jie Du Wan ==
 * In Wikipedia, I found the following page containing a table listing a number of herbal formulas. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_classic_herbal_formula. One of the formulas called "Huang Lian Jie Du Wan" has been used for treating diseases such as Alzheimer's. 
 * PubMED: For example, the following PubMed article describes a study involving the use of Huang Lian Jie Du Wan decoction in Alzheimer's (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18524483). I just wonder if any of Huajun's TCM databases contain information (e.g., ingredient herbs) about "Huang Lian Jie Du Wan".
