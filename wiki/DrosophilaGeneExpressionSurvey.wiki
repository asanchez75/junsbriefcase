It does not tolerate the gene names very well. Quite a few false positive genes were returned.

Questions:
== The difference between ArrayExpress, FlyAtlas, and 4DExpress ==
 * ArrayExpress contains array data from many different experiments, while FlyAtlas hosts only array data from its own experiment
 * 4DExpress contains in situ gene expression data from different species and it also allows one to compare the [] expression of genes of similar expression


== Programmatic access to these 3 databases ==
 * ArrayExpress has web services
 * We have a SPARQl endpoint over FlyAtlas but it needs to be updated
 * 4DExpression [TODO]

== Goal with using these expression datasets ==
 * Cluster the array expression of drosophila genes in testis in order to identify clusters of genes, which can be downstream analyzed
    ** retrieve their GO function annotations, to see whether they share any functions or to identify outstanding genes
