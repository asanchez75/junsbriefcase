#Using Ontologies for Visualizing Design Heterogeneity in Human Studies

Abstract: The human studyome is the totality of all human studies
worldwide, encompassing all interventional, observational and qualitative
research on human subjects. The human studyome is one of the most valuable
sources of knowledge for advancing the understanding of diseases and
treatments. Dr. Sim will discuss her NCBO Driving Biological Project that
sought to use ontologies to visualize design heterogeneity in randomized
trials for comparative effectiveness researchers. She will also discuss
some observations on the benefits and challenges of applying ontologies
and ontology tools to computerizing the human studyome and to clinical
research in general.

Life Cycle of human study:
  * HS performance
  * HS interpretation
  * HS application

there is a gap between performance and application.

Summary data is not helpful. We need metadata to pull the data out of the tables published in a paper. What is the meaning of a table? is the crucial thing.

OCRe (Ontology for Clinical Research)
  * include concepts to describe study designs, e.g. criteria
  * Study design typesï¼š Velos clinical information system, not very easy to understand what they mean. OCRe proposes quantitative and qualitative, working together with epidemiologists.

Study designs vary

Allow users to annotate and rank the results.
allow users to upload data to analyse them. turned out to be quite difficult. how to map them. needs a lot of processing
